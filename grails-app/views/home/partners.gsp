            When the <a
                href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/">Big Nerd Ranch</a> started out, we did one thing and we did it well: we taught programming languages. Now, over a decade later, we&#8217;ve expanded to include consulting, software products and an ever-growing library of <a
                href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/books">Big Nerd Ranch books</a>.</p>
        <p style="text-align: right;">The key to the Ranch getting bigger - and better - every day? We started out teaching, but we never stopped learning. Our teachers became experts. Who became consultants. And they learned even more. All that knowledge influenced our software products division. And our software products division? Everything they learn comes back to influence our classes and our consulting. So every horse in our proverbial stable helps make the others that much stronger.</p>
        <p style="text-align: right;">Notice a theme here? Learning. It&#8217;s at the core of everything we do now and everything we&#8217;ll do in the future.</p>

            <a href="http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector">Reflector</a> is the easiest way to display your iOS screen on your Mac or PC. Instead of sending screenshots, recorded videos or unfinished app builds, present concepts and betas in real time from real hardware. Just like the iOS simulator, enable frames to show what an application will look like on a real device. With Reflector, there's no need to worry about distributing beta apps or installing software. Wirelessly display your device using services that are already built in. Instead of using a lightning or 30-pin cable, Reflector connects wirelessly from the presenter's hands for an easy and seamless presentations and demos.

            Windows Azure Mobile Services allows developers to add a scalable and
            secure backend hosted in Windows Azure to native iOS apps written in
            Objective-C. Mobile Services makes it easy to structure your storage, add
            user authentication via Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, or Google account,
            and send push notifications.  All you need is ten minutes and about as
            many lines of code.  That means you can focus on building a great user
            experience instead of backend infrastructure.  You can always reach the
            Mobile Services team directly through <a href="mailto:iOS@microsoft.com">iOS@microsoft.com</a>.</p>
